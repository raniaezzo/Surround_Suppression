        "Description": "The experiment is coded to run in two ways depending on whether the primary variable of interest is behavioral or neural. For the behavioral task, stimuli are presented to the right and left of fixation; contrast response functions are the main output; fixed contrast levels are tested; and subjects are asked to make a contrast judgement either by adjustment or discrimination. For the neural task, stimuli are presented inside the specified RF and its symmetrical but opposite location; the behavioral output is from a letter detection task at fixation; contrast levels of the embedded and isolated stimulus are identical; and subjects are simply asked remain fixating and to press a button when an A appears on the screen.",

If running expPar=neural, you would set this to the polar angle of the RF location and it's +- 180 counterpart. Otherwise, you can keep it at 0 and 180 to test positions to the left/right of fixation. Must be two values be greater than 0 and less than 360.",
